Summary Document: Unity Experiment- 1

1. Introduction This experiment involves creating an interactive game environment in
Unity where a main sphere moves on a surface plane using the WASD keys and can
jump to different levels using the Space key. The object changes color upon reaching a
new level and has the ability to shoot at interactive objects using mouse input. The
objective is to implement player movement, jumping mechanics, collision handling,
and shooting functionality while ensuring smooth gameplay.
2. Project Setup
• Cube Tag as Planes: Used to define different surfaces for movement and
interaction.
• Surface Plane: The base ground on which the sphere starts.
• 8 Jump Planes: Platforms positioned at different heights for the player to jump
onto.
• 8 Collide Objects: Interactive objects placed on the planes for shooting
interaction.
• Shoot Point: Designated point from which the player can fire projectiles.
• Main Sphere: The primary player object used for jumping and movement.

 Methodology
   
3.1 Game Environment Setup
1. Creating the Surface Plane: A base plane is set up for the player's initial
movement.
2. Adding Jump Planes: 8 planes are positioned at different heights to serve as
jumping levels.
3. Adding Collide Objects: 8 interactive objects are placed on planes for shooting.
4. Defining the Shoot Point: A specific point is set for the player to fire projectiles.
   
3.2 Player Controls Implementation
• The movement of the player is controlled using the WASD keys.
• Jumping functionality is enabled using the Space key.
• Collision detection is implemented to ensure interaction with planes and
objects.

3.3 Level-Based Color Change

• The player object changes color upon reaching a new level to indicate
progression.

3.4 Shooting Mechanism
• The player can shoot projectiles at collide objects using mouse input.
• Proper hit detection ensures interaction between projectiles and objects.

3.5 Collision Handling
• Collision is managed between the sphere, planes, and interactive objects.
• Shooting interactions are properly detected to register successful hits.

4. Results and Observations
• The player object successfully moves using the WASD keys.
• Jumping to different levels using the Space key is functional.
• The color of the player object changes upon reaching new levels.
• The shooting mechanism effectively interacts with the collide objects.
• Collision handling ensures proper interaction between the player, planes, and
interactive elements.

6. Conclusion This experiment demonstrated fundamental game development
principles, including player movement, jumping mechanics, collision detection,
shooting, and interaction. The structured setup with tagged cubes as planes and
defined interactive elements ensured a well-organized game environment.
